# StarfieldCanvas
A Xojo Canvas subclass that simulates a moving star field.

## Usage
Basic usage is simple. Add the `StarField` module to your project. This can be done by copying it from the IDE's navigator from within the included demo project. Then drop the `StarFieldCanvas` control onto a window and call the control's `Start()` method.

The included demo project is very simple but demonstrates the variable FPS and star speed settings.
